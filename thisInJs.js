// var self = this; // in this case, this will refer to the global object, ie. the .js file

// new foo(); // new acts as a constructer, and the this of the foo function will refer to the new created object.

// function foo(a,b,c) {};

// var bar = {};
// foo.call(bar, 1,2,3); // this is an example of explicitly setting this. in this case the "this" inside of foo, will be set to bar.
